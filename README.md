<!-- Project title -->
# Jelly Invaders

<!-- Small introduction to game in 2/3 sentences. -->
# Intro
This browser game has been created using a few concepts of the classic Space Invaders.
It is my first project whilst studying at General Assembly in the Software Engineering Immersive. 


<!-- Short description about motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. -->
<!-- why this project matters -->
## Motivation
Since this is my first project whilst learning to code, I decided to create a game that I would enjoy. I decided to create a game containing some of the basics of Space Invaders, but also add my own ideas to. The pixel art in Space Invaders influenced me want to create a similar game, however I wanted to use a different theme to the classic.

## Getting Started
The game is deployed on GitHub Pages and it can be found here: https://github.com/missreems/project-01

Download the source code of the game using the clone button on the GitHub page. To play the game, open the index.html file in your browser and click 'Start'. If any issues arise, check the console. All images used within the game are PNG files and are stored in the assets folder. There are a range of sprites avaiable if you would like to change your player or jellies.


## Game Architecture

Jelly Invaders is a game where the user moves the player and attempts to shoot all the moving jellies on the 10x10 grid before it reaches the bottom. The player can be moved left and right using the left and right arrow keys, and can shoot using the 'V' key.

The game currently has one wave of jellies.

When the player is shooting, the speed of the shot is slightly faster than the movement of the jellies. However, the speed of the first wave of jellies does keep the user on their toes as the functionality of the arrow keys only allows for the player to move one cell at a time, rather than being pressed down to quickly move across the grid.
