<!-- Project title -->
# Jelly Invaders

<!-- Small introduction to game in 2/3 sentences. -->
# Intro
This browser game has been created using a few concepts of the classic Space Invaders.
It is my first project whilst studying at General Assembly in the Software Engineering Immersive. 


<!-- Short description about motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. -->
<!-- why this project matters -->
## Motivation
Since this project was my first using a coding language, I decided to create a game that I would enjoy. I wanted to create a game that would have some of the basics of Space Invaders, but also add my own ideas to. The pixel art in Space Invaders really made me want to create a similar version, however I wanted to replace the sci-fi theme of the game and make it work for sprites that looked quite cute!
